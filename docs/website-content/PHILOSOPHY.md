## "About Us" / "Our Story" Page

### Why We Built This

**We know you're not QuickBooks-ready yet. That's okay.**

Booksmaster wasn't built in a boardroom by people who've never run a business. It was built by a contractor who started four businesses in three years. Some failed fast. Some limped along for months. One finally stuck.

Through all of them, one thing never changed: **the receipts kept piling up**.

Every January, that shoebox of receipts turned into a nightmare. Hours of manual data entry. Tesseract OCR that couldn't tell a dump slip from a dinner receipt. Accountants charging $500 just to make sense of the chaos.

The big guys - Xero, QuickBooks, Wave - they're built for businesses with employees, inventory systems, and five-year plans. **That's not most of us.**

Most of us are:
- Trying idea #3 after idea #2 didn't pan out
- Solo contractors doing good work but bad bookkeeping
- Real estate investors with 47 receipts from Home Depot and no system
- Freelancers who just need their damn receipts categorized

**We built Booksmaster for the 85% of entrepreneurs who won't make it to year 5 with the same business.** Not because we want you to fail - but because we know pivoting, trying again, and starting over is **part of the process**, not a sign of failure.

## "Who This Is For" Section

### You Might Be Here Because:

✓ You're on business idea #2 (or #5) this year  
✓ You have a shoebox of receipts and tax season is coming  
✓ You tried Wave's "intelligent OCR" and it's... not intelligent  
✓ Xero costs $300/year for features you'll never use  
✓ You're a contractor, not a CFO  
✓ You spend more time on receipts than growing your business  
✓ You just want your accounting to not suck  

**If that's you, you're in the right place.**

## "How We're Different" Section

### What Makes Booksmaster Actually Different

#### 1. AI That Actually Works
Xero uses OCR from 2010. Wave uses "intelligent" OCR (it's not). We use **Gemini AI** that understands context.

**What that means:**
- Sees "Inbound Weight: 8860 lb" and knows it's a manifest, not an expense
- Links your payment receipt to the itemized receipt automatically
- Categorizes based on vendor patterns, not just keywords
- Gets smarter the more you use it

**We're the only accounting software with true AI parsing.** Everyone else is using ancient Tesseract OCR and calling it "smart."

#### 2. Built for Real Businesses
We don't assume you're hiring employees next quarter. We don't expect you to need inventory management. We don't force payroll features you'll never touch.

**You get:**
- Unlimited AI receipt scanning (not an $8/mo add-on)
- Smart categorization that learns
- Manifest/supplemental doc detection (contractors rejoice)
- Export to QuickBooks when you're ready to scale

**You don't get:**
- 47 features you'll never use
- "Growth plan" upsells
- Industry jargon that assumes you have a finance degree

#### 3. No Vendor Lock-In
We export to QuickBooks, CSV, JSON, PDF. **Use us until you outgrow us, then leave with your data.**

We're not betting on you being stuck with us. We're betting on you remembering we solved your pain point when you start business #4.

#### 4. Honest Pricing
- **Starter:** $9.99/mo - Unlimited AI scanning, all core features
- **Pro:** $19.99/mo - Bank connections, multi-user, advanced reports

**Not $300/year after a bait-and-switch promo. Not $24/mo in hidden add-ons.**

## "The Honest Truth" Section

### Here's What We're Not Telling You

Most accounting software sells you a fantasy:

> "Grow your business! Scale! Hire! You're going to be the next unicorn!"

**Here's reality:**
- 50% of businesses fail by year 5
- Most entrepreneurs try 3-4 ventures before finding success
- You might pivot six times before something sticks
- That's **normal**, not failure

We're not here to shame you for still being a sole proprietor in year 3. We're not assuming you'll have employees by Q4. We're not judging you for trying a new idea after the last one didn't work out.

**We're just here to make sure your receipts don't become a tax-season crisis when you're trying to figure out what's next.**

### Problem Section

**You shouldn't spend 10 hours a month fighting with receipts.**

Every contractor, freelancer, and solo entrepreneur knows this cycle:
1. Do the work (the part you love)
2. Get paid (pretty good)
3. Stuff receipt in console/wallet/pocket (eh, I'll deal with it later)
4. Tax season arrives (oh no)
5. Spend entire weekend manually entering receipts (I hate my life)
6. Swear you'll do better next year (narrator: they didn't)

**The big accounting software companies don't solve this.** They give you more features, more complexity, more dashboards. But they don't solve the core problem:

**Your receipts are a mess, and OCR from 2010 can't read them.**

---

### Solution Section

**What if your receipts just... handled themselves?**

Upload a receipt. **Gemini AI reads it like a human would:**
- Recognizes it's a dump manifest, not an expense
- Links it to the invoice you got later
- Categorizes it based on your business patterns
- Flags it for your attention if something looks weird

**Not keyword matching. Not dumb OCR. Actual intelligence.**

Takes 30 seconds. Done.

That's it. That's the whole product.

### FAQ Section

**Q: Is this just OCR with better marketing?**  
No. We use Gemini AI, which understands context. It knows "Inbound Weight" means it's a manifest. OCR just reads characters. Big difference.

**Q: What happens when I outgrow this?**  
Export everything to QuickBooks, CSV, or JSON and move on. We're genuinely rooting for you to succeed and scale beyond us.

**Q: Why so cheap?**  
Because we're not building enterprise payroll, inventory management, or 47 integrations you'll never use. We solve one problem really well: receipt chaos.

**Q: What if my business fails and I start a new one?**  
Pause your subscription, or cancel and come back. We know how this works. Your data exports clean, and re-onboarding for a new venture takes 2 minutes.

**Q: Do you judge me for being on business idea #4?**  
Absolutely not. The founder is on business idea #6. We get it.
