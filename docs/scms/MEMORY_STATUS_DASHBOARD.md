**Project:** Thomas Books  
**Project Phase:** Greenfield (< 4 weeks)  
**Initialized:** December 28, 2024

## Promotion Threshold Configuration

**Current Threshold:** **n ≥ 5** (Greenfield phase: Weeks 1-4)

**Why this threshold?**
- New projects need more evidence before patterns become mandatory rules
- Prevents premature optimization and over-engineering
- Allows exploration and experimentation

**Threshold Evolution:**
- **Greenfield (Weeks 1-4):** n ≥ 5 uses
- **Establishing (Months 2-3):** n ≥ 3 uses
- **Mature (4+ months):** n ≥ 2 uses

**Next Threshold Change:** Approximately January 25, 2025 (4 weeks from init)
